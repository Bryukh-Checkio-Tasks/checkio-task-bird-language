    Stephan has a friend - the little mechbird.
    And he was trying to learn it to speak a long time.
    And, today the bird said the first word "hieeelalaooo".
    This sounds like "hello" but with many vowels.
    Stephan had asked to help Nikola and he examined how the bird changes words.
    Now we should make the translator module.
</p>

<div>
    The bird converts words by two rules:<br>
<ul>
    <li>- after each consonant letter the bird append a random vowel letter (l ⇒ la or le);</li>
    <li>- after each vowel letter the bird append two same letters (a ⇒ aaa);</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<p>
    You are given a bird phrase as several words which are separated by white-spaces (each pair of words by one whitespace).
    The bird don't know punctuation symbols, just letters.
    All words are given in lowercase. You should translate this phrase from the bird language.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A bird phrase as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The translation as a string.
</p>


<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
translate("hieeelalaooo") == "hello"
translate("hoooowe yyyooouuu duoooiiine") == "how you doin"
translate("aaa bo cy da eee fe") == "a b c d e f"
translate("sooooso aaaaaaaaa") == "sos aaa"
    </pre>
</div>

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This like a cipher that is using by children when they invent their own "bird" language.
    But now you will be ready ;-)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    re.match("\A([a-z]+\ ?)+(?&lt;!\ )\Z", phrase)<br>
    A phrase always has the translation.
